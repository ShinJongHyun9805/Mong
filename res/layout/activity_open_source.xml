	  The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
	to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast\u002C
	the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to
	share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free
	software for all its users.  We\u002C the Free Software Foundation\u002C use the
	GNU General Public License for most of our software\u003B it applies also to
	any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to
	your programs\u002C too.


	  When we speak of free software\u002C we are referring to freedom\u002C not
	price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
	have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
	them if you wish)\u002C that you receive source code or can get it if you
	want it\u002C that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
	free programs\u002C and that you know you can do these things.


	  To protect your rights\u002C we need to prevent others from denying you
	these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore\u002C you have
	certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software\u002C or if
	you modify it\u003A responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.


	  For example\u002C if you distribute copies of such a program\u002C whether
	gratis or for a fee\u002C you must pass on to the recipients the same
	freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they\u002C too\u002C receive
	or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they
	know their rights.


	  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps\u003A
	(1) assert copyright on the software\u002C and (2) offer you this License
	giving you legal permission to copy\u002C distribute and/or modify it.


	  For the developers\u0027 and authors\u0027 protection\u002C the GPL clearly explains
	that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users\u0027 and
	authors\u0027 sake\u002C the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as
	changed\u002C so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to
	authors of previous versions.


	  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run
	modified versions of the software inside them\u002C although the manufacturer
	can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of
	protecting users\u0027 freedom to change the software.  The systematic
	pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to
	use\u002C which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore\u002C we
	have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those
	products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains\u002C we
	stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions
	of the GPL\u002C as needed to protect the freedom of users.


	  Finally\u002C every program is threatened constantly by software patents.
	States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of
	software on general-purpose computers\u002C but in those that do\u002C we wish to
	avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could
	make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this\u002C the GPL assures that
	patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.


	  The precise terms and conditions for copying\u002C distribution and
	modification follow.


	                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS


	  0. Definitions.


	  \u0022This License\u0022 refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.


	  \u0022Copyright\u0022 also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of
	works\u002C such as semiconductor masks.


	  \u0022The Program\u0022 refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
	License.  Each licensee is addressed as \u0022you\u0022.  \u0022Licensees\u0022 and
	\u0022recipients\u0022 may be individuals or organizations.


	  To \u0022modify\u0022 a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work
	in a fashion requiring copyright permission\u002C other than the making of an
	exact copy.  The resulting work is called a \u0022modified version\u0022 of the
	earlier work or a work \u0022based on\u0022 the earlier work.


	  A \u0022covered work\u0022 means either the unmodified Program or a work based
	on the Program.


	  To \u0022propagate\u0022 a work means to do anything with it that\u002C without
	permission\u002C would make you directly or secondarily liable for
	infringement under applicable copyright law\u002C except executing it on a
	computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying\u002C
	distribution (with or without modification)\u002C making available to the
	public\u002C and in some countries other activities as well.


	  To \u0022convey\u0022 a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
	parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through
	a computer network\u002C with no transfer of a copy\u002C is not conveying.


	  An interactive user interface displays \u0022Appropriate Legal Notices\u0022
	to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible
	feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice\u002C and (2)
	tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the
	extent that warranties are provided)\u002C that licensees may convey the
	work under this License\u002C and how to view a copy of this License.  If
	the interface presents a list of user commands or options\u002C such as a
	menu\u002C a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.


	  1. Source Code.


	  The \u0022source code\u0022 for a work means the preferred form of the work
	for making modifications to it.  \u0022Object code\u0022 means any non-source
	form of a work.


	  A \u0022Standard Interface\u0022 means an interface that either is an official
	standard defined by a recognized standards body\u002C or\u002C in the case of
	interfaces specified for a particular programming language\u002C one that
	is widely used among developers working in that language.


	  The \u0022System Libraries\u0022 of an executable work include anything\u002C other
	than the work as a whole\u002C that (a) is included in the normal form of
	packaging a Major Component\u002C but which is not part of that Major
	Component\u002C and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that
	Major Component\u002C or to implement a Standard Interface for which an
	implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A
	\u0022Major Component\u0022\u002C in this context\u002C means a major essential component
	(kernel\u002C window system\u002C and so on) of the specific operating system
	(if any) on which the executable work runs\u002C or a compiler used to
	produce the work\u002C or an object code interpreter used to run it.


	  The \u0022Corresponding Source\u0022 for a work in object code form means all
	the source code needed to generate\u002C install\u002C and (for an executable
	work) run the object code and to modify the work\u002C including scripts to
	control those activities.  However\u002C it does not include the work\u0027s
	System Libraries\u002C or general-purpose tools or generally available free
	programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but
	which are not part of the work.  For example\u002C Corresponding Source
	includes interface definition files associated with source files for
	the work\u002C and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically
	linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require\u002C
	such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those
	subprograms and other parts of the work.


	  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users
	can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding
	Source.


	  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that
	same work.


	  2. Basic Permissions.


	  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
	copyright on the Program\u002C and are irrevocable provided the stated
	conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
	permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a
	covered work is covered by this License only if the output\u002C given its
	content\u002C constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your
	rights of fair use or other equivalent\u002C as provided by copyright law.


	  You may make\u002C run and propagate covered works that you do not
	convey\u002C without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains
	in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose
	of having them make modifications exclusively for you\u002C or provide you
	with facilities for running those works\u002C provided that you comply with
	the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do
	not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works
	for you must do so exclusively on your behalf\u002C under your direction
	and control\u002C on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of
	your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.


	  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under
	the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed\u003B section 10
	makes it unnecessary.


	  3. Protecting Users\u0027 Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.


	  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
	measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article
	11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996\u002C or
	similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such
	measures.


	  When you convey a covered work\u002C you waive any legal power to forbid
	circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention
	is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to
	the covered work\u002C and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or
	modification of the work as a means of enforcing\u002C against the work\u0027s
	users\u002C your or third parties\u0027 legal rights to forbid circumvention of
	technological measures.


	  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.


	  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program\u0027s source code as you
	receive it\u002C in any medium\u002C provided that you conspicuously and
	appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice\u003B
	keep intact all notices stating that this License and any
	non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code\u003B
	keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty\u003B and give all
	recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.


	  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey\u002C
	and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.


	  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.


	  You may convey a work based on the Program\u002C or the modifications to
	produce it from the Program\u002C in the form of source code under the
	terms of section 4\u002C provided that you also meet all of these conditions\u003A


	    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified
	    it\u002C and giving a relevant date.


	    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is
	    released under this License and any conditions added under section
	    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to
	    \u0022keep intact all notices\u0022.


	    c) You must license the entire work\u002C as a whole\u002C under this
	    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This
	    License will therefore apply\u002C along with any applicable section 7
	    additional terms\u002C to the whole of the work\u002C and all its parts\u002C
	    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no
	    permission to license the work in any other way\u002C but it does not
	    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.


	    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces\u002C each must display
	    Appropriate Legal Notices\u003B however\u002C if the Program has interactive
	    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices\u002C your
	    work need not make them do so.


	  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent
	works\u002C which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work\u002C
	and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program\u002C
	in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium\u002C is called an
	\u0022aggregate\u0022 if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not
	used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation\u0027s users
	beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work
	in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other
	parts of the aggregate.


	  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.


	  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms
	of sections 4 and 5\u002C provided that you also convey the
	machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License\u002C
	in one of these ways\u003A


	    a) Convey the object code in\u002C or embodied in\u002C a physical product
	    (including a physical distribution medium)\u002C accompanied by the
	    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium
	    customarily used for software interchange.


	    b) Convey the object code in\u002C or embodied in\u002C a physical product
	    (including a physical distribution medium)\u002C accompanied by a
	    written offer\u002C valid for at least three years and valid for as
	    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product
	    model\u002C to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a
	    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the
	    product that is covered by this License\u002C on a durable physical
	    medium customarily used for software interchange\u002C for a price no
	    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this
	    conveying of source\u002C or (2) access to copy the
	    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.


	    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the
	    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This
	    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially\u002C and
	    only if you received the object code with such an offer\u002C in accord
	    with subsection 6b.


	    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated
	    place (gratis or for a charge)\u002C and offer equivalent access to the
	    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no
	    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the
	    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to
	    copy the object code is a network server\u002C the Corresponding Source
	    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)
	    that supports equivalent copying facilities\u002C provided you maintain
	    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the
	    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the
	    Corresponding Source\u002C you remain obligated to ensure that it is
	    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.


	    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission\u002C provided
	    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding
" />

            <TextView
                android:layout_width="match_parent"
                android:layout_height="wrap_content"
                android:layout_marginLeft="3dp"
                android:text="    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no
    charge under subsection 6d.


  A separable portion of the object code\u002C whose source code is excluded
from the Corresponding Source as a System Library\u002C need not be
included in conveying the object code work.


  A \u0022User Product\u0022 is either (1) a \u0022consumer product\u0022\u002C which means any
tangible personal property which is normally used for personal\u002C family\u002C
or household purposes\u002C or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation
into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product\u002C
doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular
product received by a particular user\u002C \u0022normally used\u0022 refers to a
typical or common use of that class of product\u002C regardless of the status
of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user
actually uses\u002C or expects or is expected to use\u002C the product.  A product
is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial
commercial\u002C industrial or non-consumer uses\u002C unless such uses represent
the only significant mode of use of the product.


  \u0022Installation Information\u0022 for a User Product means any methods\u002C
procedures\u002C authorization keys\u002C or other information required to install
and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from
a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must
suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object
code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because
modification has been made.


  If you convey an object code work under this section in\u002C or with\u002C or
specifically for use in\u002C a User Product\u002C and the conveying occurs as
part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the
User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a
fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized)\u002C the
Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied
by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply
if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install
modified object code on the User Product (for example\u002C the work has
been installed in ROM).


  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a
requirement to continue to provide support service\u002C warranty\u002C or updates
for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient\u002C or for
the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a
network may be denied when the modification itself materially and
adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and
protocols for communication across the network.


  Corresponding Source conveyed\u002C and Installation Information provided\u002C
in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly
documented (and with an implementation available to the public in
source code form)\u002C and must require no special password or key for
unpacking\u002C reading or copying.


  7. Additional Terms.


  \u0022Additional permissions\u0022 are terms that supplement the terms of this
License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.
Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall
be treated as though they were included in this License\u002C to the extent
that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions
apply only to part of the Program\u002C that part may be used separately
under those permissions\u002C but the entire Program remains governed by
this License without regard to the additional permissions.


  When you convey a copy of a covered work\u002C you may at your option
remove any additional permissions from that copy\u002C or from any part of
it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own
removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place
additional permissions on material\u002C added by you to a covered work\u002C
for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.


  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License\u002C for material you
add to a covered work\u002C you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of
that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms\u003A


    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the
    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License\u003B or


    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or
    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal
    Notices displayed by works containing it\u003B or


    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material\u002C or
    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in
    reasonable ways as different from the original version\u003B or


    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or
    authors of the material\u003B or


    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some
    trade names\u002C trademarks\u002C or service marks\u003B or


    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that
    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of
    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient\u002C for
    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on
    those licensors and authors.


  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered \u0022further
restrictions\u0022 within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you
received it\u002C or any part of it\u002C contains a notice stating that it is
governed by this License along with a term that is a further
restriction\u002C you may remove that term.  If a license document contains
a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this
License\u002C you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms
of that license document\u002C provided that the further restriction does
not survive such relicensing or conveying.


  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section\u002C you
must place\u002C in the relevant source files\u002C a statement of the
additional terms that apply to those files\u002C or a notice indicating
where to find the applicable terms.


  Additional terms\u002C permissive or non-permissive\u002C may be stated in the
form of a separately written license\u002C or stated as exceptions\u003B
the above requirements apply either way.


  8. Termination.


  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly
provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or
modify it is void\u002C and will automatically terminate your rights under
this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third
paragraph of section 11).


  However\u002C if you cease all violation of this License\u002C then your
license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
provisionally\u002C unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
finally terminates your license\u002C and (b) permanently\u002C if the copyright
holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means
prior to 60 days after the cessation.


  Moreover\u002C your license from a particular copyright holder is
reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
violation by some reasonable means\u002C this is the first time you have
received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
copyright holder\u002C and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
your receipt of the notice.


  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
reinstated\u002C you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same
material under section 10.


  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.


  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or
run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work
occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission
to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However\u002C
nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or
modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do
not accept this License.  Therefore\u002C by modifying or propagating a
covered work\u002C you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.


  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.


  Each time you convey a covered work\u002C the recipient automatically
receives a license from the original licensors\u002C to run\u002C modify and
propagate that work\u002C subject to this License.  You are not responsible
for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.


  An \u0022entity transaction\u0022 is a transaction transferring control of an
organization\u002C or substantially all assets of one\u002C or subdividing an
organization\u002C or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered
work results from an entity transaction\u002C each party to that
transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever
licenses to the work the party\u0027s predecessor in interest had or could
give under the previous paragraph\u002C plus a right to possession of the
Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest\u002C if
the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.


  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the
rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example\u002C you may
not impose a license fee\u002C royalty\u002C or other charge for exercise of
rights granted under this License\u002C and you may not initiate litigation
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that
any patent claim is infringed by making\u002C using\u002C selling\u002C offering for
sale\u002C or importing the Program or any portion of it.


  11. Patents.


  A \u0022contributor\u0022 is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this
License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The
work thus licensed is called the contributor\u0027s \u0022contributor version\u0022.


  A contributor\u0027s \u0022essential patent claims\u0022 are all patent claims
owned or controlled by the contributor\u002C whether already acquired or
hereafter acquired\u002C that would be infringed by some manner\u002C permitted
by this License\u002C of making\u002C using\u002C or selling its contributor version\u002C
but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a
consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For
purposes of this definition\u002C \u0022control\u0022 includes the right to grant
patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of
this License.


  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive\u002C worldwide\u002C royalty-free
patent license under the contributor\u0027s essential patent claims\u002C to
make\u002C use\u002C sell\u002C offer for sale\u002C import and otherwise run\u002C modify and
propagate the contents of its contributor version.


  In the following three paragraphs\u002C a \u0022patent license\u0022 is any express
agreement or commitment\u002C however denominated\u002C not to enforce a patent
(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to
sue for patent infringement).  To \u0022grant\u0022 such a patent license to a
party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a
patent against the party.


  If you convey a covered work\u002C knowingly relying on a patent license\u002C
and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone
to copy\u002C free of charge and under the terms of this License\u002C through a
publicly available network server or other readily accessible means\u002C
then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so
available\u002C or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the
patent license for this particular work\u002C or (3) arrange\u002C in a manner
consistent with the requirements of this License\u002C to extend the patent
license to downstream recipients.  \u0022Knowingly relying\u0022 means you have
actual knowledge that\u002C but for the patent license\u002C your conveying the
covered work in a country\u002C or your recipient\u0027s use of the covered work
in a country\u002C would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that
country that you have reason to believe are valid.


  If\u002C pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or
arrangement\u002C you convey\u002C or propagate by procuring conveyance of\u002C a
covered work\u002C and grant a patent license to some of the parties
receiving the covered work authorizing them to use\u002C propagate\u002C modify
or convey a specific copy of the covered work\u002C then the patent license
you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered
work and works based on it.


  A patent license is \u0022discriminatory\u0022 if it does not include within
the scope of its coverage\u002C prohibits the exercise of\u002C or is
conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are
specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered
work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is
in the business of distributing software\u002C under which you make payment
to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying
the work\u002C and under which the third party grants\u002C to any of the
parties who would receive the covered work from you\u002C a discriminatory
patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work
conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies)\u002C or (b) primarily
for and in connection with specific products or compilations that
contain the covered work\u002C unless you entered into that arrangement\u002C
or that patent license was granted\u002C prior to 28 March 2007.


  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting
any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may
otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.


  12. No Surrender of Others\u0027 Freedom.


  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order\u002C agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License\u002C they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a
covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations\u002C then as a consequence you may
not convey it at all.  For example\u002C if you agree to terms that obligate you
to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey
the Program\u002C the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this
License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.


  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.


  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License\u002C you have
permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed
under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single
combined work\u002C and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this
License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work\u002C
but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License\u002C
section 13\u002C concerning interaction through a network will apply to the
combination as such.


  14. Revised Versions of this License.


  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of
the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version\u002C but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.


  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the
Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General
Public License \u0022or any later version\u0022 applies to it\u002C you have the
option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered
version or of any later version published by the Free Software
Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the
GNU General Public License\u002C you may choose any version ever published
by the Free Software Foundation.


  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future
versions of the GNU General Public License can be used\u002C that proxy\u0027s
public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you
to choose that version for the Program.


  Later license versions may give you additional or different
permissions.  However\u002C no additional obligations are imposed on any
author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a
later version.


  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.


  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM\u002C TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \u0022AS IS\u0022 WITHOUT WARRANTY
OF ANY KIND\u002C EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED\u002C INCLUDING\u002C BUT NOT LIMITED TO\u002C
THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM
IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE\u002C YOU ASSUME THE COST OF
ALL NECESSARY SERVICING\u002C REPAIR OR CORRECTION.


  16. Limitation of Liability.


  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER\u002C OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS
THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE\u002C BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES\u002C INCLUDING ANY
GENERAL\u002C SPECIAL\u002C INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE
USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF
DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD
PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS)\u002C
EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
SUCH DAMAGES.


  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.


  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided
above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms\u002C
reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates
an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the
Program\u002C unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a
copy of the Program in return for a fee.


                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS


            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs


  If you develop a new program\u002C and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public\u002C the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.


  To do so\u002C attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
state the exclusion of warranty\u003B and each file should have at least
the \u0022copyright\u0022 line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.


    \u003Cone line to give the program\u0027s name and a brief idea of what it does.\u003E

    This program is free software\u003A you can redistribute it and/or modify
    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
    the Free Software Foundation\u002C either version 3 of the License\u002C or
    (at your option) any later version.


    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful\u002C
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY\u003B without even the implied warranty of
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
    GNU General Public License for more details.


    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
    along with this program.  If not\u002C see \u003Chttps\u003A//www.gnu.org/licenses/\u003E.


Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.


  If the program does terminal interaction\u002C make it output a short
notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode\u003A


    \u003Cprogram\u003E  Copyright (C) \u003Cyear\u003E  \u003Cname of author\u003E

    under certain conditions\u003B type \u0060show c\u0027 for details.


The hypothetical commands \u0060show w\u0027 and \u0060show c\u0027 should show the appropriate
parts of the General Public License.  Of course\u002C your program\u0027s commands
might be different\u003B for a GUI interface\u002C you would use an \u0022about box\u0022.


  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school\u002C
if any\u002C to sign a \u0022copyright disclaimer\u0022 for the program\u002C if necessary.
For more information on this\u002C and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL\u002C see
\u003Chttps\u003A//www.gnu.org/licenses/\u003E.


  The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program
into proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library\u002C you
may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with
the library.  If this is what you want to do\u002C use the GNU Lesser General
Public License instead of this License.  But first\u002C please read
\u003Chttps\u003A//www.gnu.org/licenses/why-not-lgpl.html\u003E.
